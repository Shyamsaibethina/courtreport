# CourtReport
This app provides court information not found through default map apps. It displays courts near your location, and shows information such as weather, types of courts available, amount of courts, whether the courts are indoor, and time it takes to get to the courts. It can also connect to Google or Apple Maps to show directions. The app is made with Swift and SwiftUI and developed on Xcode.
